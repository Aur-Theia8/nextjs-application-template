# Detailed Implementation Plan for AURA Meet Pop-up Component

## Overview
This plan describes the creation of a self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript component that displays a discreet, premium pop-up advertisement for AURA Meet on the AURA FR LTD website. The pop-up appears automatically 20 seconds after page load, features a 10-second countdown timer, and includes "Découvrir" and "✖ Fermer" buttons. The design is modern with a black background, white text, and gold accents, and it is responsive to different screen sizes.

## File Changes and Dependencies
- **New File Creation:**  
  Create a file named `aura-popup.html` containing the complete HTML, embedded CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Integration Note:**  
  This file is self-contained. No modifications are needed to existing files; simply copy-paste the contents into the main site where required.

## Step-by-Step Outline

1. **HTML Structure**
   - **Document Setup:**  
     - Start with the DOCTYPE declaration and basic `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` structure.
   - **Overlay and Popup Container:**  
     - Add a `<div id="aura-popup-overlay">` that covers the entire screen with a semi-transparent black background.
     - Inside the overlay, add a `<div id="aura-popup">` for the pop-up content.
   - **Pop-up Elements:**  
     - **Timer Display:** Include a `<div id="popup-timer">` at the top that shows the countdown ("Cette fenêtre se fermera dans 10…9…8…").
     - **Close Button:** Create a `<button id="popup-close">✖ Fermer</button>` positioned at the top-right corner.
     - **Logo:** Add a `<div class="popup-logo">AURA FR LTD</div>` to serve as the textual logo.
     - **Content Text:** Insert a `<p>` element with the text: "Découvrez aussi AURA Meet – un service exclusif de mise en relation haut de gamme (Europe / Afrique)."
     - **Discover Button:** Add a `<button id="popup-discover">Découvrir</button>` that, when clicked, redirects the user to a configurable URL.

2. **CSS Styling**
   - **Overlay Styles:**  
     - Use fixed positioning with full viewport dimensions and a semi-transparent background (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)`).
   - **Popup Container Styles:**  
     - Center the pop-up using flexbox or absolute positioning.
     - Apply a black background, white text, and gold highlights (e.g., for the logo and discover button) to create a premium look.
     - Add padding, border-radius, and shadow for an elegant feel.
   - **Element-Specific Styles:**  
     - Style the timer element to be prominent.
     - Position the close button in the upper-right corner.
     - Ensure buttons have hover effects and are clearly clickable.
   - **Responsive Design:**  
     - Add media queries to adjust sizing and layout for mobile devices.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - **Initialization:**  
     - Wrap the script in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) and listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
   - **Delayed Display:**  
     - Use `setTimeout` to call a `showPopup()` function 20 seconds after page load.
   - **Countdown Timer:**  
     - Within `showPopup()`, initialize a 10-second countdown using `setInterval`, updating the inner text of the timer element each second.
     - Auto-close the pop-up when the count reaches zero.
   - **Event Listeners:**  
     - Attach a click event to the "✖ Fermer" button to immediately close the pop-up.
     - Attach a click event to the "Découvrir" button to redirect to a configurable URL (set in a variable, e.g., `redirectUrl = "http://example.com"`).
   - **Error Handling & Cleanup:**  
     - Use try/catch blocks around DOM access and timer functions to gracefully handle errors.
     - Clear the countdown interval when the pop-up is closed to avoid memory leaks.

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - **Integration:**  
     - Copy the complete HTML snippet into the main website’s body.
     - Ensure the unique IDs and class names do not conflict with existing styles.
   - **Testing:**  
     - Verify the pop-up appears automatically after 20 seconds.
     - Test the countdown timer to ensure it updates every second and auto-closes after 10 seconds.
     - Confirm that the "✖ Fermer" button and the "Découvrir" button (with redirection) work as expected.
   - **Best Practices:**  
     - Use namespaced IDs and classes for isolation.
     - Keep the code lightweight and modular for easy adjustments.

## Summary
- A new file `aura-popup.html` is created with self-contained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The pop-up appears on the main site 20 seconds after load with an elegant design.
- It features a 10-second countdown timer, a text-based logo, and premium styling.
- Both “Découvrir” and “✖ Fermer” buttons are implemented with appropriate redirection and immediate closure.
- Responsive design and error handling are included to ensure reliability.
